# Spring Data MyBatis

This directory contains two sample applications for using Spring Data MyBatis
with the Spanner JDBC driver.

- [GoogleSQL](googlesql): This sample uses the Spanner GoogleSQL dialect.
- [PostgreSQL](postgresql): This sample uses the Spanner PostgreSQL dialect and the Spanner JDBC
  driver. It does not use PGAdapter. The sample application can also be configured to run on open
  source PostgreSQL, and shows how a portable application be developed using this setup.
