   ### Creating a JDBC Connection
   
   The following example shows how to create a JDBC connection to Cloud Spanner and execute a simple query.
   
   ```java
   String projectId = "my-project";
   String instanceId = "my-instance";
   String databaseId = "my-database";
   
   try (Connection connection =
       DriverManager.getConnection(
           String.format(
               "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s",
               projectId, instanceId, databaseId))) {
     try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
       try (ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()")) {
         while (rs.next()) {
           System.out.printf(
               "Connected to Cloud Spanner at [%s]%n", rs.getTimestamp(1).toString());
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   ### Connection URL Properties
   
   The Spanner JDBC driver supports the following connection URL properties. Note that all of
   these can also be supplied in a Properties instance that is passed to the
   `DriverManager#getConnection(String url, Properties properties)` method.

   #### Commonly Used Properties
   - credentials (String): URL for the credentials file to use for the connection. If you do not specify any credentials at all, the default credentials of the environment as returned by `GoogleCredentials#getApplicationDefault()` is used. Example: `jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/my-project/instances/my-instance/databases/my-db;credentials=/path/to/credentials.json`
   - autocommit (boolean): Sets the initial autocommit mode for the connection. Default is true.
   - readonly (boolean): Sets the initial readonly mode for the connection. Default is false.
   - autoConfigEmulator (boolean): Automatically configure the connection to try to connect to the Cloud Spanner emulator. You do not need to specify any host or port in the connection string as long as the emulator is running on the default host/port (localhost:9010). The instance and database in the connection string will automatically be created if these do not yet exist on the emulator. This means that you do not need to execute any `gcloud` commands on the emulator to create the instance and database before you can connect to it. Example: `jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/test-project/instances/test-instance/databases/test-db;autoConfigEmulator=true`
   - usePlainText (boolean): Sets whether the JDBC connection should establish an unencrypted connection to a (local) server. This option can only be used when connecting to a local emulator that does not require an encrypted connection, and that does not require authentication. Example: `jdbc:cloudspanner://localhost:9010/projects/test-project/instances/test-instance/databases/test-db;usePlainText=true`
   - optimizerVersion (String): Sets the default query optimizer version to use for this connection. See also https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/query-optimizer/query-optimizer-versions.
   - enableExtendedTracing (boolean): Enables extended OpenTelemetry tracing of queries that are executed by a JDBC connection. When enabled, the SQL string of the query that is executed is added as a property to the trace.
   
   #### Advanced Properties
   - minSessions (int): Sets the minimum number of sessions in the backing session pool. Defaults to 100.
   - maxSessions (int): Sets the maximum number of sessions in the backing session pool. Defaults to 400.
   - numChannels (int): Sets the number of gRPC channels to use. Defaults to 4.
   - retryAbortsInternally (boolean): The JDBC driver will by default automatically retry aborted transactions internally. This is done by keeping track of all statements and the results of these during a transaction, and if the transaction is aborted by Cloud Spanner, it will replay the statements on a new transaction and compare the results with the initial attempt. Disable this option if you want to handle aborted transactions in your own application.
   - oauthToken (string): A valid pre-existing OAuth token to use for authentication for this connection. Setting this property will take precedence over any value set for a credentials file.
   - lenient (boolean): Enable this to force the JDBC driver to ignore unknown properties in the connection URL. Some applications automatically add additional properties to the URL that are not recognized by the JDBC driver. Normally, the JDBC driver will reject this, unless `lenient` mode is enabled.
   
   ### OpenTelemetry Tracing
   The Spanner JDBC driver supports OpenTelemetry tracing. You can configure the OpenTelemetry instance
   that should be used in two ways:
   1. Register a global OpenTelemetry instance. This instance will automatically be picked up by the Spanner JDBC driver.
   2. Add an OpenTelemetry instance with the key `openTelemetry` to the `java.util.Properties` instance that is used to create the JDBC connection.
   
   By default, the traces that are generated by the Spanner JDBC driver do not include the SQL
   statement. You can include the SQL statement with the traces by adding the property `enableExtendedTracing=true`
   to the JDBC connection URL.
   
   #### Example Using Global OpenTelemetry
   Create and register a global OpenTelemetry object before creating a JDBC connection.
   See also the [Spring Data JDBC Sample](samples/spring-data-jdbc) for an example for how to
   configure OpenTelemetry in combination with Spring Data.
   
   ```java
   TraceConfiguration traceConfiguration = TraceConfiguration.builder().setProjectId("my-project").build();
   SpanExporter traceExporter = TraceExporter.createWithConfiguration(traceConfiguration);
   OpenTelemetry openTelemetry =
        OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
            .setTracerProvider(
                SdkTracerProvider.builder()
                    .setSampler(Sampler.traceIdRatioBased(0.05))
                    .setResource(
                        Resource.builder()
                            .put("service.name", "my-unique-service-name")
                            .build())
                    .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(traceExporter).build())
                    .build())
            .buildAndRegisterGlobal();
   String projectId = "my-project";
   String instanceId = "my-instance";
   String databaseId = "my-database";
   // Setting this to true instructs the JDBC driver to include the SQL statement with the traces.
   boolean enableExtendedTracing = true;
   
   try (Connection connection =
       DriverManager.getConnection(
           String.format(
               "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s?enableExtendedTracing=%s",
               projectId, instanceId, databaseId, enableExtendedTracing))) {
     try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
       try (ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()")) {
         while (rs.next()) {
           System.out.printf(
               "Connected to Cloud Spanner at [%s]%n", rs.getTimestamp(1).toString());
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   #### Example Using an OpenTelemetry instance in Properties
   Create and register a global OpenTelemetry object before creating a JDBC connection.
   See also the [Spring Data JDBC Sample](samples/spring-data-jdbc) for an example for how to
   configure OpenTelemetry in combination with Spring Data.
   
   ```java
   TraceConfiguration traceConfiguration = TraceConfiguration.builder().setProjectId("my-project").build();
   SpanExporter traceExporter = TraceExporter.createWithConfiguration(traceConfiguration);
   OpenTelemetry openTelemetry =
        OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
            .setTracerProvider(
                SdkTracerProvider.builder()
                    .setSampler(Sampler.traceIdRatioBased(0.05))
                    .setResource(
                        Resource.builder()
                            .put("service.name", "my-unique-service-name")
                            .build())
                    .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(traceExporter).build())
                    .build())
            .build();
   String projectId = "my-project";
   String instanceId = "my-instance";
   String databaseId = "my-database";
   // Setting this to true instructs the JDBC driver to include the SQL statement with the traces.
   boolean enableExtendedTracing = true;
   
   Properties info = new Properties();
   info.put(JdbcDriver.OPEN_TELEMETRY_PROPERTY_KEY, openTelemetry);
   info.put("enableExtendedTracing", String.valueOf(enableExtendedTracing));
   
   try (Connection connection =
       DriverManager.getConnection(
           String.format(
               "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s",
               projectId, instanceId, databaseId))) {
     try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
       try (ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()")) {
         while (rs.next()) {
           System.out.printf(
               "Connected to Cloud Spanner at [%s]%n", rs.getTimestamp(1).toString());
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
