 * Cloud Spanner can abort any read/write transaction because of potential deadlocks or other
 * internal reasons. When a transaction is aborted, the entire transaction should be retried. A
 * {@link Connection} can automatically retry a transaction internally and check whether the results
 * that are returned during a retry attempt are equal to the results during the original
 * transaction. This is done by keeping track of a SHA-256 checksum of all the results that are
 * returned by Spanner during both transactions.
 *
 * <p>This listener class for internal transaction retries allow client applications to do
 * additional testing or logging of transaction retries. Transaction retry listeners of a {@link
 * Connection} can be added using {@link
 * Connection#addTransactionRetryListener(TransactionRetryListener)}.
